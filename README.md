# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.


## Summary
The primary objective of this model development and deployment is to build a method for predicting the marketing overturn for different clients by correlating the prediction to contextual inputs such as profession, job, marital status, education, period, duration, campaign information and so on. The main metric to predict is the possibilit of the individual returning a positive reaction or replying back to a marketing campaign by the bank. As a result, the ouput is of a dichotomous nature where it represents two possible outcomes- a yes or a no. Based on the predictive models that were used in this study, we can conclude that VotingEnsemble is the best method for predicting the outputs and offers the highest accuracy, which is only slightly better than the HyperdriveCongig paramterization.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
